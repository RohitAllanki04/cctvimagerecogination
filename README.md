# FaceTrace AI: Intelligent Face Detection and Matching System
FaceTrace AI is a Python-based system that performs automatic face detection and matching using OpenCV and OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model. It is designed for fast, robust recognition and comparison of facial images, suitable for batch processing and scalable cloud storage using PostgreSQL.

# Features
Face Detection: Detects faces in images using Haar Cascades (OpenCV).

Embedding & Recognition: Converts faces to high-dimensional embeddings for similarity search using CLIP (ViT base patch16).

Preprocessing: Upscaling, Gaussian blur, and histogram equalization for reliability.

Similarity Search: Cosine similarity measures closeness between input faces and dataset.

Robust Error Handling: Automatic feedback and exception handling for reliability.


Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceTrace-AI.git
cd FaceTrace-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Requirements:

Python 3.7+

OpenCV (cv2)

Pillow (PIL)

Transformers (transformers)

NumPy (numpy)

PostgreSQL (optional, for cloud storage)

Usage
Place your dataset images in a folder (e.g., dataset/).

Get your Haar Cascade XML (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).

Run the detection and matching script:

bash
python Dipproject.py
You will be prompted for:

Input image path

Dataset folder path

Extracted faces and matches will be displayed and saved in the extracted-faces folder.

Pipeline Overview
Image Preprocessing: Upscaling, blurring, and histogram equalization.

Face Detection: Haar Cascade classifier locates faces.

Face Extraction: Crops and saves detected faces.

Embedding Generation: Uses CLIP to obtain 512-dim vector for each face.

Similarity Check: Cosine similarity matches faces against dataset.

Technical Stack
Component	Purpose
OpenCV	Face detection and image enhancement

PostgreSQL	Optional cloud storage for embeddings
FAQ
Why Haar Cascade?

Fast, lightweight, ideal for frontal face detection; can upgrade to MTCNN or YOLO for better results.

Why CLIP embeddings?

Zero-shot robustness, state-of-the-art image vectors suitable for fast matching.

How is similarity measured?

Using cosine similarity between normalized embeddings.

How to improve accuracy?

Use advanced detectors, fine-tune CLIP, increase dataset diversity, adjust thresholds.

Optimization Ideas
Replace Haar Cascade with YOLO-face/MTCNN.

Integrate async I/O for faster image loading.

Store embeddings in PostgreSQL for large datasets.

Apply face alignment, quantization, and temperature scaling techniques for advanced use.
